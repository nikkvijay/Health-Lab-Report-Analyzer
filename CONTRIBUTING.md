- **Frontend**: Node.js 18+, npm/yarn
- **Tools**: Git, Docker (optional)

### Fork and Clone
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Health-Lab-Report-Analyzer.git
   cd Health-Lab-Report-Analyzer
   ```

3. Add the original repository as upstream:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/nikkvijay/Health-Lab-Report-Analyzer.git
   ```

### Environment Setup

#### Backend Setup
```bash
cd HLRA-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
python main.py
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd HLRA-frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/description-of-bug`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/critical-issue`
- **Documentation**: `docs/what-docs-change`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/what-is-being-refactored`

### Workflow Steps
1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd HLRA-backend && pytest
   
   # Frontend tests
   cd HLRA-frontend && npm test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new health metric extraction"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Conventional Commits
We use conventional commit messages. Format: `type(scope): description`

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix  
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes (no code change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(upload): resolve file size validation issue
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation
test(extraction): add OCR service unit tests
```
